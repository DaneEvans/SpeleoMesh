## MeshMonitor 

[MeshMonitor](https://github.com/DaneEvans/meshMonitor) is designed as a whole network monitor.

It is a selfhosted webapp, that can be run on a RaspberryPi Zero, using a network or serial Meshtastic radio, or a radio shield.

### Features
- Battery tracking
- online nodes
- Battery warnings

#### Coming Soon

- Network diagrams
- Improved handling of node renaming

## Config program
The configurator is in Flamingo/utils, and makes it easy to bring up radios consistently.

I have intentions to make a GUI front end on it, but it probably needs to be written into pure python, not python using the cli before that occurs.
